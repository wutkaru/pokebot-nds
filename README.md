End of life of the Pokebot NDS Update :

Due to life things and Game Freak announcing they are shutting down Pokemon Bank. I no longer am going to continue fixing and updating this program. Feel free to do what you wish with this program, just give me and the original programmer credit where due. Thank you for all the support and understanding.

This repository is dedicated to creating a multi-purpose automated tool for the mainline DS Pokémon games.

## Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
You'll need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), and have a recent version of [DeSmuME](https://github.com/TASEmulators/desmume/releases/latest) in order to use this tool. 

#### Installation
**Recommended**: Install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and locally clone this repository to stay up to date with the latest versions of the bot.

Alternatively, download the repository as a .zip archive and extract it anywhere you like.

#### Setup
1. Start the dashboard with `start-dashboard.bat`, or run these commands inside the `dashboard/` folder:
    - `npm i`
    - `npm start`
2. Use the dashboard's Config tab to customise the bot behaviour for your current task. 
3. Open the Lua Console, and load `pokebot-nds.lua`. `Tools > Lua Scripting > New Lua Script Window`

NOTE: Bizhawk has MAJOR issues and is no longer supported.

The game will then be connected to the dashboard, which you can view info for on the Dashboard tab. The bot will immediately start acting according to your Config, and log any encounters to the dashboard.
